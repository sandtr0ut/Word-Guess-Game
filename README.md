### Gameplay 

Like the subtitle says, Word-Guess Game is just like the traditional Hangman, but without all the violence and fuss of a guy being hanged.

- A word is selected, at-random, from a pre-determined list of words (all related to Downeast seafood, in this case) and the player keys in  guesses until she guesses the word or runs out of guesses.

- In a departure from the traditional Hangman format, Word-Guess dynamically sets the number of incorrect guesses that a player is allowed, based on the number of letters in the word, plus a margin of error.  The longer the word, the more chances the player gets.  In Hangman, you just get nine guesses (assuming no hands, feet or ears on the stick figure), no matter what.

- The game keeps track of and displays the letters you have already used and does not penalize you for pressing an incorrect key more than once.

- Finally, the game keeps a tally of wins so you can compare your performance as you grind out hours of fun.
